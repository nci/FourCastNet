FourCastNet Inference
=====================

This repository is forked from the official [FourCastNet](https://github.com/NVlabs/FourCastNet).
For references and citations, please refer to the official repository.

In addition to the official FourCastNet, this repository contains code that performs inference
on NCI version of ERA5 from project rt52.

Additional documentation for FourCastNet may be found on the [FourCastNet documentation](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/DAE/FourCastNet).

Setup
-----

* Ask to join NCI project rt52 on [mancini](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini).

* Run `bash setup.sh` to set up the environment. This script sets up a Python virtualenv with all the
  required dependencies.

* The inference requires pretrained weights and input normalization statistics. These files are now at
  `/g/data/wb00/admin/staging/FourCastNet/v0`.

Notebooks
---------

We also provided several Jupyter notebooks under the `notebooks` directory.
These notebooks demonstrate:

* Baseline inference on the out-of-distribution sample data provided by the original authors
  The code for baseline inference is under the `inference` directory. 

* Inference on NCI ERA5
  The code for inference on NCI ERA5 is under the `inference_nci` directory. 
  
Data Location
---------------------
The data used in the FourCastNet project is available at `/g/data/wb00/FourCastNet/`. This dataspace contains two directories: nci and nvlabs. The nci directory contains the predictions and models generated by NCI. The nvlabs folder contains the data and models provided by nvlabs on their repository. More information may be found on the [FourCastNet documentation](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/DAE/FourCastNet) and notebook itself.

Inference on NCI ERA5
---------------------

The inference algorithm on NCI ERA5 works as follows:

```

INPUTS:  start_time
         end_time
         prediction_length
         initial conditions (i.e. raw ERA5 data)

OUTPUTS: predictions in zarr format

let t = start_time

while t <= end_time:
  load initial conditions at t to initialize FourCastNet

  forecast from t+1 to t+1 + prediction_length

  t += t+1 + prediction_length

```

The inference code is tested to support both CPU and GPU. With GPU support, we use CUDA 11.7 which can
be loaded via `module load cuda/11.7.0` on Gadi.

A demonstration to run the inference script `inference_nci/inference.py` is `test_inference.sh`.

* To run `test_inference.sh`, one needs to modify `checkpoint_dir` and `stats_dir` to point to the right
  location.

* With a short prediction length specified in `test_inference.sh`, one can run the script directly from
  Gadi login node to get quick results in a few minutes.
